# PRD: Agent Abstraction Layer

**Author:** Gemini CLI Agent
**Date:** July 23, 2025
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for creating a robust Agent Abstraction Layer within the Gemini CLI codebase. The goal is to refactor the existing agentic logic into a modular, reusable, and extensible framework. This will decouple the core agent orchestration from specific implementations of language models and client environments, paving the way for future enhancements and integrations.

## 2. The Problem

The current agentic logic, primarily located in `CoreToolScheduler`, is tightly coupled with the Gemini API and the specific needs of the interactive CLI. This architecture presents several challenges:

*   **Limited Reusability:** The agent logic cannot be easily reused in other contexts (e.g., a web backend, a different CLI tool) without significant refactoring.
*   **Difficult to Test:** The tight coupling makes it hard to test the agent's decision-making process in isolation from the Gemini API and the CLI's UI.
*   **Model Dependency:** Swapping out the Gemini model for a different one (e.g., from OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local model) would require substantial changes throughout the core logic.
*   **Reduced Extensibility:** Adding new capabilities beyond the current tool-based architecture would be complex and could lead to a monolithic and hard-to-maintain codebase.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this initiative is to evolve the existing agentic system into an enterprise-ready framework. The key objectives are:

*   **Decouple Core Logic:** Abstract the core agent orchestration (the "main loop") from the specifics of the language model and the client environment.
*   **Enhance Reusability:** Enable the agent to be used as a standalone component in various applications.
*   **Improve Testability:** Allow for the agent's logic to be tested independently using mock components.
*   **Promote Extensibility:** Create a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new tools, models, and capabilities.
*   **Future-Proof the Architecture:** Lay the groundwork for more advanced features, such as multi-agent systems, without requiring a complete rewrite.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Core Interfaces

The following interfaces must be defined to create the abstraction layer:

*   **`Agent` Interface:**
    *   The central component of the framework.
    *   Exposes a `run(prompt, signal)` method to process a user request.
    *   Provides an event-based system (`on(event, handler)`) for subscribing to key lifecycle events (e.g., `tool-call-update`, `final-response`, `error`).
    *   Manages the overall conversation flow and tool execution loop.

*   **`LanguageModel` Interface:**
    *   Abstracts the interaction with a specific LLM.
    *   Defines a `generateResponse(history, tools)` method that takes the conversation history and available tools and returns an `LLMResponse`.
    *   The `LLMResponse` will contain either a text response or a list of tool calls.

*   **`ToolRegistry` Interface:**
    *   Maintains the existing functionality of discovering, registering, and retrieving tools.
    *   Will be used by the `Agent` to provide the list of available tools to the `LanguageModel`.

### 4.2. Concrete Implementation: `GeminiCliAgent`

A concrete implementation of the `Agent` interface, named `GeminiCliAgent`, will be created. This class will encapsulate the existing agentic logic:

*   It will implement the `Agent` interface.
*   It will use a new `GeminiModel` class (which implements the `LanguageModel` interface) to interact with the Gemini API.
*   It will use the existing `CoreToolScheduler` internally to manage the tool execution lifecycle.
*   The `gemini.tsx` file will be updated to use the `GeminiCliAgent` instead of directly interacting with the `CoreToolScheduler`.

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of this enhancement will be measured by the following:

*   **Zero Regression:** All existing functionality of the CLI must remain intact.
*   **Code Modularity:** The new architecture should clearly separate the concerns of agent orchestration, model interaction, and tool management.
*   **Test Coverage:** The new components (`Agent` interface, `GeminiCliAgent`, `GeminiModel`) should have comprehensive unit tests.
*   **Ease of Extension:** A developer should be able to add a new language model (e.g., a mock model for testing) by simply creating a new class that implements the `LanguageModel` interface, with minimal changes to the rest of the codebase.
